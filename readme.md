# React Server Base

This repository is intended for cloning to get up and running with the following stack:
- React
- React Templates
- ReactJs History
- Babel with ES2015 support
- Bootstrap and jQuery for UI prototyping.
- Webpack - for compiling client assets
- Karma and Jasmine for testing

It is intended to work with the server of your choice. Connect to your api in client/api/{env}.

We may want to evolve this base architecture and set of dependencies with the following:
- A documented state management system (redux/relay)
